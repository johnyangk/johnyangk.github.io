  - I found and reported two critical consensus bugs in Ethereum. One of the bugs led to the 2020/11/11 Ethereum hard fork (News: [Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereums-hard-fork-disruption), [Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/47891/how-a-dormant-bug-briefly-split-the-ethereum-blockchain), [Korean News](https://news.v.daum.net/v/20210407103321396))
